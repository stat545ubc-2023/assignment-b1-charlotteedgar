STAT545B Assignment B1 

The Mean of columns function.rmd file shows code for how I made a function that takes the mean and standard deviations of numeric columns in a dataset. It also includes and examples and tests to show how the function works.

I knitted the rmd file so that it can be viewed as an html document or a pdf (Mean-of-columns-function.html or Mean-of-columns-function.pdf respectfully).
